Find an available computer, once you do so just download Git. Once it's downloaded just open it and if you don't have an account then you can create an account on GitHub with password  and email address. After an account has been made just look for where it says “New Repository” and if you want to set it to public or private. Then if you want to work with a repository just make a copy of it. After that, just keep an eye out and find the “code” button so you can start. Afterwards you can just stay logged in on the website so you can get to know it better and be more comfortable using it. To download Webstorm go find an available computer once that's done download and install it. After it's done installing just open it and you'll be greeted with a welcome screen. If you want you can customize the settings to your preference before you can start coding. Then you can get familiar with Webstorm by practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code so you get used to more.
